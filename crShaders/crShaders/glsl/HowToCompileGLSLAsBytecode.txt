Windows

Create a CompileAsBytecode.bat file with the following contents:

C:/VulkanSDK/x.x.x.x/Bin/glslc.exe shader.vert -o vert.spv
C:/VulkanSDK/x.x.x.x/Bin/glslc.exe shader.frag -o frag.spv
pause

Replace the path to glslc.exe with the path to where you installed the Vulkan SDK. Double click the file to run it.

//Note:  Both glslc and glslangvalidator.exe require the filenames to end in ".vert" and ".frag" for the shader types to correctly recognized by these command line tools!
